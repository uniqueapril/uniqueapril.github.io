    <h1> UPDATE LOGS </h1>
    <a href="index.html">Go back to homepage!</a>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.7 </h2>
    <p> New meme in Image Gallery and mandantory Height and Width settings in image gallery set </p>
     <p> Small Update </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.6 </h2>
    <p> lol just forgot to add back to whatever pages i forgot and fixed like one bug </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.5 </h2>
    <p> Small update, scheduled construction on the website to find out what was wrong with the CSS. </p>
    <p> Found out I did not update the CSS on the github page, and in VSCODE i would have to go with a lot of problems by linking the css file, to a HTML file, and the CSS file is in a another file, so I made it easy </p>
    <p> -for myself by making the folder files link to the github CSS file. Problem with Github CSS is that sometimes it will take hours to update CSS cause this weird bug. </p>
    <p> Small patch today, other than me finishing up yesterdays update by adding a go back to homepage link on this page. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.4 </h2>
        <p> Small update, tutorial page updated and patchin' up messy corners of website and brainstorming </p>
        <p> Real good honorable mention is that i've added "go back to homepage" to the website. First one to come with this was the IMTIMFM. Also working on designing that finally lol</p>
        <p> (also just revamping the whole IMTIMFM page cause it for some reason have the CSS stylesheet in it, alongside other metadata tags.)</p>
        <p> Alongside CSS talk, next update I'm gonna patch up some CSS issues which might cause the website to go under maintenance.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.3 </h2>
    <p> Index.html page redesigned, IMTIMFM page set up as of v0.0.2, update log setup. Working on new project and setting up folder index files. </p>
    <p> Some honorable mentions to this version is that I now have a favicon set up for the website. </p>
    <p> Another Honorable mention is that i decided to cut out the contact page at the last minute, I find it useless. </p>
