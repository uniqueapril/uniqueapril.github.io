    <h1> UPDATE LOGS </h1>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.4 </h1>
        <p> Small update, tutorial page updated and patchin' up messy corners of website and brainstorming </p>
        <p> Real good honorable mention is that i've added "go back to homepage" to the website. First one to come with this was the IMTIMFM. Also working on designing that finally lol</p>
        <p> (also just revamping the whole IMTIMFM page cause it for some reason have the CSS stylesheet in it, alongside other metadata tags.)</p>
        <p> Alongside CSS talk, next update I'm gonna patch up some CSS issues which might cause the website to go under maintenance.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Update Log v0.0.3 </h1>
    <p> Index.html page redesigned, IMTIMFM page set up as of v0.0.2, update log setup. Working on new project and setting up folder index files. </p>
    <p> Some honorable mentions to this version is that I now have a favicon set up for the website. </p>
    <p> Another Honorable mention is that i decided to cut out the contact page at the last minute, I find it useless. </p>
